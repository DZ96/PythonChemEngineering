# PythonChemEngineering
Here you can find different Python scripts useful for chemical/process engineers. For example sizing of safety/control valves, pressure drop calculations, etc.
I started with some scripts about sizing of safety and control valves. The scripts use fluids and coolprop libraries. The accompanying PDFs are used for taking the initial conditions and comparison of the results.
